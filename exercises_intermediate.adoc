This document contains all the intermediate exercises. If you find an error or a bug or something that could be written better, please get in contact with me. Thanks.

== Exercise 006

Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:

Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]

Following are the fixed values of C and H:

- C is 50. H is 30.
- D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.

Example:

Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program: 100,150,180

The output of the program should be: 18,22,24

=== Hints:

- use `math.Sqrt` for the square root
- use `math.Round` for rounding a float operation

== Exercise 007

Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.

Example

Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5

Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

=== Hints:
Note: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-separated form.

=== Solution:

== Exercise 008

Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
    
    without,hello,bag,world

Then, the output should be:

    bag,hello,without,world

=== Hints:

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

=== Solution:

== Exercise 009

Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines 
after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

    Hello world
    Practice makes perfect

Then, the output should be:

    HELLO WORLD
    PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

=== Hints
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

=== Solution:

== Exercise 010

Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

    hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again

Then, the output should be:

    again and hello makes perfect practice world

=== Hints

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
We use set container to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted() to sort the data.

== Solution:

== Exercise 011

Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.

Example:
    0100,0011,1010,1001

Then the output should be:
    1010

Notes: Assume the data is input by console.

=== Hints:

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

=== Solution:

link:011/exercise011.go[]


== Exercise 012

Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 100 and 300 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

=== Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.


=== Solution:

== Exercise 013

Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits. 

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

    hello world! 123

Then, the output should be:

    LETTERS 10
    DIGITS 3

=== Hints:
 In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
